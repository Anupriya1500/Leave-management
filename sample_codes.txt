Flow=---------------------

models mai boolean fields add kari
make cancel form(from date, to date both disabled, reason for cancellation)
this form class must have a save method which will make Is _cancelled to True and is_pending to True and It will append the cancel reason in already reason text
 of that obj 
frontend mai for detail view of leave req , when approved we get cancel button
 for urls.py add path for that particular cancel button hit ,a new Html Page is created for that Cancel Form 
views.py create a fn for that url req which will create a cancel req for the user leave adn send it to LM
{
    if leave.is_approved and not is_pending:
        We have to crwate a cancelrequestForm with initial data of that particular leave obj (passing from date , to date ,and reason (Blank ))
        and call the same method of that form obj
} 

LM Side
Granting cancel leave req
fro accepting or rejecting the cancel request we have to change the already created Grant leave request form class to make the status field as disabled 
and when passing the initial data from views we have to create a logic for setting the status using if or else statements on the boolean fields of leave obj like Is_pending , Is _approved,_is_rejected
then we have to make changes in the save method of grant leave request class to mark the boolean fields to is_pending =False, is approved to t or F,to_rejected to T or False, IsCancell to T or F

name=anuj
to find all the leaves of anuj where his leave request is in pending and is cancel and line_manager is On leave
Leave.objects.filter(employee=='Anuj', status=='Pending')
